    <h1 class="front-title">XQuery 3.0 Features</h1>
    <p>XQuery 3.0 has been released as a working draft in December 2011. The new XQuery 3.0 specification
    standardizes many of the features which had been available as extension modules in eXist and other 
    implementations for quite a while, for example: higher-order functions, try/catch or group by.</p>
    <p>The following sections present usage examples for those new features. If you click on the
    edit link, the example snippet will be loaded into eXide so you can run, edit and play around
    with it.</p>
